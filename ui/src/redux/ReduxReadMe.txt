Current Goals in order:
- Obtain Data (What data is important to us and saving it into the global variables)
- Build Classes by parsing through the data to set intialState (Accesing Global variables to build out initialState)
- Render State Data on the Front End (Start with first element in state array)
- Add the ability to render specific elements through the dropdown
- Add the start/stop/delete functionality


This doc will serve as a guide to the changes and inner machinations of the application. It will walk you through where to start reading in order to understand structure, as well as provide
some instructions on how to make changes particular to the redux functionality of the app.

I. Where to start. How does it work?
   Here we can explain the setup for our store, and the slices, as well as any related classes

II. Where and how to add functionality
  Here will be a guide on where to add any additional reducers or functionality

III. Current Functionality 
    Here we can list all the reducers and functionality of the application in (current version) and describe how they affect state

IV. Things to consider
    List of things we may have forgotten to discuss/implement, or any stretch features
