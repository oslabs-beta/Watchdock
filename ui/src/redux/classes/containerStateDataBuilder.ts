In here we will build the class/constructor (which one?) that we will reference/call in our initialStateBuilder.ts 
file in order to parse through the containerData global variable to fill out the related container info.

We will use the "name" or "id" property of the current image to find the 
correct containers in our containerData object to build an array of objects referencing that information.
