Updates from clientSetup:

- Added script in main folder "setup" that can be run to install all main, ui and vm dependencies in one go
- Added script in main folder "build" that runs build commands in both ui and vm
- Added ddClient to the ui and tested its functionality
- Setting up docker-compose.yml in order to connect socks between ui and vm
- Services will more than likely need o be split
